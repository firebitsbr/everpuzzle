## Goal
Build a game similar to Tetris Attack and Pok√©mon Puzzle. The game should be similar but also extend on the game concepts of the old games. Check out the todo file to see stuff I want to do.

## [Downloads](https://github.com/Skytrias/everpuzzle/releases)
If you encounter any issues with releases, please send an issue, try running the game in debug mode with RUST_BACKTRACE=1.
